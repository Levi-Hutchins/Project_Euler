## What is Project Euler?
" Project Euler is a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems that will require more than just mathematical insights to solve. Although mathematics will help you arrive at elegant and efficient methods, the use of a computer and programming skills will be required to solve most problems.

The motivation for starting Project Euler, and its continuation, is to provide a platform for the inquiring mind to delve into unfamiliar areas and learn new concepts in a fun and recreational context." <br>

## Why am I attempting these problems?
I discovered the Project Euler page on Hacker Rank and was immediately fascinated since I have a passion for programming and a genuine interest in mathematics. I completed the first problem and began on the second one within a couple of hours. After diving into what exactly project Euler was I thought it would it a good idea to showcase some of my solutions to the problems.
