## Problem 1
if we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.
Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below N.

### Test Case
* As Described above. *<br>
For N = 10, if we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6  and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.
Therefore if N = 100 the sum is 2318


### Contraints
- 1 < T < $10^5$
- 1 < N < $10^9$

### Explaination
$\left( \sum_{k=1}^n \right)$
